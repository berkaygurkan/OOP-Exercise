Carefully copy or cut and paste the program P51.cpp into a file called ex51.cpp.  Compile and run the program to make sure it compiles without any error.  Create a file, input.txt, and type the following 8 integers in it: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4.  Save the file and exit.  Now, run your program and when the program asks for the input file, type input.txt.  
Your program should display an output similar to the one given below:

          x               x^2            Current Sum
        ===             ===          ==========
          4               16              4
          4               16              8
          4               16              12
          4               16              16
          4               16              20
          4               16              24
          4               16              28
          4               16              32

                 The average of these 8 numbers is: 4
This is the correct result.
