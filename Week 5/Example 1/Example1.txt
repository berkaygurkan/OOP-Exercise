Modify the P11_1.cpp program to ask users for two strings then:
    1) Append the second string to the end of the first string and display the resulting string,

    2) Display a message on whether or not the word is a Palindrome.  Such strings are the same when you write them backward.
    For example:  race + car = racecar  .... this word written backwards is also racecar, thus, it is a palindrome.
