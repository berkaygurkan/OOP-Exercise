/*
Lets create a program that draws a diamond or a triangle with a size that the user selects using 
a specific character that will be entered at the keyboard.  

Here are two examples:

A triangle of size using * character:
   *        1    (n*2-1) -> number of stars per line
  ***       3    (n-1) -> number of blanks in reverse order
 *****      5
*******     7

A diamond of size 4, using *:
   *            
  ***          
 *****      
*******
 *****
  ***
   *
   *
