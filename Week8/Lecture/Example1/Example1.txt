Modify the program
1) make function add of type AltMoney.  Thus, this function now computes the sum of dollars and cents and returns it as class.
Note that in the above version of the program, you have passed the object sum as call_by_reference.
2) add a new friend function, subtract, that computes the subtraction of one money from the other.
3) Make read_money a member function.  Note that if you make read_money a member function, then you can use it to directly 
initialize the dollars and cents of an AltMoney type object directly.
